# VizBot: AI-Powered Meeting Visualization Platform
**Date:** 01/15/2025 | **Author:** John Smith, CEO | **Status:** Review

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Launch VizBot, an AI meeting assistant that automatically joins virtual meetings and generates real-time visual diagrams from conversations. With 65% of people being visual learners and $500/hour manual graphic recording services proving demand, VizBot addresses a $2B market opportunity while improving meeting comprehension by 3x.

## CUSTOMER PROBLEM
**Who:** 50M+ knowledge workers in daily virtual meetings  
**What:** Complex ideas get lost in verbal discussions; 73% report missing critical information while trying to sketch diagrams  
**Impact:** $31B annually in lost productivity from ineffective meetings (avg 31 hours/month wasted)  
**Why Now:** Remote work permanence + LLM capabilities reaching visualization quality threshold + Cerebras enabling 2000 tokens/sec generation

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
AI bot that joins Zoom/Meet calls and creates live visualizations on an infinite whiteboard. When teams discuss architectures, data, or processes, professional diagrams appear instantly. Each visualization is a reusable micro-frontend component stored in Bit.dev, creating an organizational knowledge graph over time.

## SUCCESS METRICS
• **Customer Acquisition:** 0 → 1,000 paying organizations by Month 12  
• **User Engagement:** 5+ visualizations per meeting average by Month 6  
• **Revenue:** $0 → $2M ARR by Month 12  
• **NPS Score:** 50+ by Month 6 (vs. 32 industry average)  
• **Visualization Accuracy:** 85%+ as rated by users by Month 3

## KEY MILESTONES
• **Technical POC Complete:** 02/28/2025  
• **Private Beta Launch (25 companies):** 04/15/2025  
• **Public Beta Launch:** 06/01/2025  
• **General Availability:** 08/01/2025  
• **Series A Fundraise:** 10/01/2025

## INVESTMENT REQUIRED
**People:** 12 FTEs - 4 backend engineers, 2 ML engineers, 2 frontend engineers, 1 designer, 1 PM, 2 sales  
**Budget:** $3M seed round (18-month runway @ $165K/month burn)  
**Timeline:** 12 months to $2M ARR (Feb 2025 - Jan 2026)  
**Infrastructure:** $50K/month for LLM APIs and Cerebras compute

## RISKS & MITIGATION
• **Visualization accuracy below expectations** (P:M, I:H): Start with technical meetings only; implement confidence scoring and human-in-loop corrections  
• **Platform API restrictions** (P:L, I:H): Build relationships with Zoom/Google; position as ecosystem enhancer, not competitor  
• **Enterprise security concerns** (P:H, I:M): SOC 2 certification by Month 4; on-premise option for Enterprise tier  
• **Competition from incumbents** (P:M, I:H): Move fast to establish market position; build component moat via Bit.dev

**Approvals:** Board of Directors, VP Engineering, VP Sales
