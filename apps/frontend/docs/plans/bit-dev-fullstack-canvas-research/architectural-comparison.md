# Architectural Comparison: Canvas Integration Options

## Overview
This document compares three architectural approaches for implementing the bit.dev fullstack canvas platform.

## Option 1: Integrate into Existing Astro App

### Pros
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reuse existing build tools, deployment pipeline, and configuration
- **Consistent Tech Stack**: Already uses React, Tailwind, and Vite
- **Unified Deployment**: Single app to deploy and maintain
- **Shared Components**: Can reuse existing UI components and styles
- **Existing Routes**: Easy to add `/canvas` route to current routing system

### Cons
- **Complexity Mixing**: Canvas functionality is very different from current marketing site
- **Bundle Size**: Canvas features would increase bundle size for all users
- **Different Requirements**: Canvas needs runtime loading, drag-drop, which marketing site doesn't
- **Deployment Coupling**: Canvas updates would require redeploying entire site
- **Performance Impact**: Heavy canvas features could slow down marketing pages

### Technical Considerations
```typescript
// Would add to existing Astro app
// src/pages/canvas.astro
---
import CanvasLayout from '../layouts/CanvasLayout.astro';
import MicroAppCanvas from '../components/canvas/MicroAppCanvas.tsx';
---
<CanvasLayout>
  <MicroAppCanvas client:only="react" />
</CanvasLayout>
```

## Option 2: Create New Dedicated App

### Pros
- **Clean Separation**: Purpose-built for canvas functionality
- **Independent Deployment**: Deploy and scale independently
- **Optimized Build**: Can optimize specifically for runtime loading and module federation
- **No Legacy Constraints**: Start fresh with ideal architecture
- **Separate Concerns**: Marketing site and canvas app have different goals

### Cons
- **Duplicate Setup**: Need to set up new build pipeline, testing, deployment
- **Shared Code**: Harder to share common utilities or components
- **Multiple Repos**: More infrastructure to maintain
- **Authentication**: Need to handle auth across apps if required
- **Domain Management**: Need subdomain or separate domain

### Technical Considerations
```typescript
// New app structure
apps/canvas/
├── src/
│   ├── host/           // Canvas host app
│   ├── registry/       // Micro-app registry
│   └── runtime/        // Module federation runtime
├── api/                // Serverless functions
│   ├── registry/       // Registry API
│   └── persistence/    // Canvas state API
└── bit-workspace/      // Bit components workspace
```

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach

### Pros
- **Best of Both**: Leverage existing infrastructure while maintaining separation
- **Gradual Migration**: Start in Astro, move to separate app if needed
- **Shared Resources**: Can share auth, styles, components through packages
- **Flexible Evolution**: Can evolve architecture based on needs
- **Monorepo Benefits**: Already in monorepo, easy to share code

### Cons
- **Initial Complexity**: Need to set up proper boundaries
- **Refactoring Risk**: Might need to refactor later anyway
- **Mixed Patterns**: Different patterns in same codebase
- **Decision Paralysis**: Harder to make clean architectural decisions

### Technical Considerations
```typescript
// Hybrid structure in monorepo
apps/
├── astro/              // Marketing site
│   └── src/pages/
│       └── canvas/     // Canvas entry point (redirects)
├── canvas-app/         // Dedicated canvas app
│   ├── src/
│   └── api/
└── shared/             // Shared packages
    ├── ui-components/
    └── auth/
```

## Serverless Architecture Comparison

### For Integrated Approach (Option 1)
- Use Astro's API routes for serverless functions
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify with existing setup
- Challenges: API routes mixed with marketing site

### For Dedicated App (Option 2)
- Purpose-built serverless architecture
- Independent API Gateway for micro-apps
- Clean separation of concerns

### For Hybrid (Option 3)
- Shared auth/user serverless functions
- Separate micro-app BFF functions
- Best flexibility for growth

## Recommendation: Option 2 - New Dedicated App

### Rationale
1. **Clean Architecture**: Canvas platform has fundamentally different requirements
2. **Scalability**: Can scale independently based on usage
3. **Performance**: Optimized for runtime loading without affecting marketing site
4. **Future-Proof**: Easier to evolve without constraints
5. **Serverless-First**: Can design optimal serverless architecture from start

### Proposed Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + Module Federation
- **Canvas**: React DnD + React Grid Layout
- **State**: Zustand or Valtio for global state
- **Backend**: Vercel Functions or Netlify Functions
- **Registry**: Serverless function with database
- **Storage**: Vercel KV or Upstash for canvas state

### Migration Path
1. Build MVP as separate app
2. Share auth if needed through JWT
3. Link from Astro site to canvas app
4. Share UI components through bit.dev
5. Eventually could merge if requirements align

## Decision Factors

### Choose Integration (Option 1) If:
- Canvas is core to main product experience
- Need tight integration with existing features
- Want to minimize infrastructure overhead
- Have small team managing everything

### Choose Dedicated (Option 2) If:
- Canvas is separate product/feature
- Need maximum flexibility and performance
- Want independent deployment and scaling
- Have resources for separate app

### Choose Hybrid (Option 3) If:
- Uncertain about long-term requirements
- Want to test canvas concept quickly
- Need gradual migration path
- Want to share significant code

## Next Steps
1. Validate serverless function setup with bit.dev
2. Create proof-of-concept for module federation
3. Test drag-drop canvas libraries
4. Design micro-app registry schema
5. Plan authentication strategy
