## Research Resources

### Bit.dev Documentation
- [Bit.dev Official Docs](https://bit.dev/docs)
- Component composition and dependencies
- Bit.dev cloud and self-hosted options
- Component versioning and distribution

### Micro-Frontend Resources
- Module Federation for fullstack apps
- Single-spa with microservices
- Webpack 5 Module Federation examples
- Micro-frontend communication patterns

### Canvas/Drag-and-Drop Libraries

- API Gateway patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Consider using a monorepo structure for micro-apps if bit.dev supports it
- Evaluate build-time vs. runtime trade-offs for performance
- Security must be a primary concern for runtime loading
- Consider progressive enhancement for canvas features
- Cerebras Qwen3 Coder 480B for AI generation (20x faster than alternatives)
- Real-time generation pipeline critical for user experience
- Template-based generation to ensure consistent quality

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual micro-app components
- Integration tests for canvas-micro-app communication
- E2E tests for drag-and-drop functionality
- Performance tests for multiple micro-app loading

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Bit.dev may not support fullstack components
  - **Mitigation**: Consider hybrid approach with separate backend deployment
- **Risk**: Runtime loading security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Implement strict CSP and sandboxing
- **Risk**: Performance degradation with multiple microservices
  - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and caching strategies
- **Risk**: Complex state management across micro-apps
  - **Mitigation**: Use proven patterns like event sourcing or CQRS
