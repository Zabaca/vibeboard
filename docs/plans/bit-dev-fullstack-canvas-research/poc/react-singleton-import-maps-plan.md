# React Singleton Import Maps Plan

## Objective
Implement a React singleton solution using import maps to enable standard ESM React components from Bit.dev, NPM, and other sources to work reliably in the AI Whiteboard POC. The goal is to fix the current issue where ESM components that use `import React from 'react'` fail due to React instance conflicts.

**Decision Update (2025-01-03)**: SystemJS fallback skipped - modern browser support for import maps is sufficient for our use case.

## Implementation Notes

### Key Design Decisions
1. **React-Only Singleton**: Only React, ReactDOM, and JSX runtime are singletons
2. **Import Maps Only**: Use native import maps (88% browser support is sufficient)
3. **No Polyfill**: Skipping SystemJS - complexity not justified for edge cases
4. **No Build-Time Changes**: Keep solution runtime-only for dynamic loading
5. **Preserve Flexibility**: Other dependencies can load independently

### React Shim Structure
```javascript
// /public/shims/react.js
const React = window.React;
export default React;
export const {
  useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback,
  createContext, useContext, Fragment, StrictMode,
  // ... all other exports
} = React;
```

### Import Map Configuration
```html
<script type="importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "react": "/shims/react.js",
    "react-dom": "/shims/react-dom.js",
    "react-dom/client": "/shims/react-dom.js",
    "react/jsx-runtime": "/shims/react-jsx-runtime.js"
  }
}
</script>
```

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome 89+ ✅
- Firefox 108+ ✅
- Safari 16.4+ ✅
- Edge 89+ ✅
- No fallback needed - 88% global support is sufficient

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. Shim modules export all required APIs
2. Import resolution works correctly
3. Browser compatibility detection works

### Integration Tests
1. Standard ESM components load and execute
2. React hooks work without errors
3. No React instance duplication
4. Components from CDN work properly

### E2E Tests
1. Load Bit.dev component successfully
2. Load NPM package via esm.sh
3. Complex component with dependencies works
4. Test across different browsers

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Simple component with standard imports
- [ ] Component using all common hooks
- [ ] Component with child components
- [ ] Third-party component library
- [ ] Performance comparison vs current approach

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Import Map Browser Support
**Risk**: Older browsers don't support import maps
**Mitigation**: Accept limitation - 88% support is sufficient for target audience
**Impact**: Low - users on legacy browsers will need to upgrade

### Risk 2: Vite Development Conflicts
**Risk**: Vite's dev server might conflict with import maps
**Mitigation**: Configure Vite to respect import maps, test thoroughly
**Impact**: Medium - may need Vite config adjustments

### Risk 3: Module Resolution Complexity
**Risk**: Complex dependency chains might fail
**Mitigation**: Start simple (React only), expand carefully
**Impact**: Low - React singleton solves main issue

### Risk 4: Performance Impact
**Risk**: Import maps might add slight overhead
**Mitigation**: Minimal impact - shims are lightweight redirects
**Impact**: Negligible - native browser feature with good performance

## Timeline Estimate
- Planning: 2 hours ✅
- Implementation: 2-3 hours ✅
  - React shims: 1 hour ✅
  - Import maps: 1 hour ✅
  - ~~SystemJS fallback: 2 hours~~ (skipped)
  - Integration: 0.5 hours ✅
- Testing: 0.5 hours ✅
- Documentation: (in progress)
- **Total**: ~5 hours (reduced from 9-12 hours by skipping SystemJS)

## Discussion

### Questions Resolved
1. **Q**: Why not make all dependencies singletons?
   **A**: Complexity without clear benefit; React is the main issue

2. **Q**: Why SystemJS over other polyfills?
   **A**: Proven solution used by StackBlitz, mature and reliable

3. **Q**: Will this work with TypeScript components?
   **A**: Yes, after transpilation they're just ESM modules

### Open Questions
1. How to handle React version mismatches?
2. Should we support multiple React versions?
3. How to handle SSR components in the future?

### Success Metrics
- [x] Standard ESM React components work without modification
- [ ] Bit.dev components load successfully
- [ ] No React instance errors in console
- [ ] Works in 95%+ of browsers (native + polyfill)
- [ ] No performance regression vs current approach

## Next Steps
1. ~~Review and approve plan~~ ✅
2. ~~Create React shim modules~~ ✅
3. ~~Implement import maps in HTML~~ ✅
4. ~~Add SystemJS fallback~~ (skipped)
5. Test with real Bit.dev component (Parent Goal 5)
6. Update ESM Executor (Parent Goal 4)
7. Clean up and document (Parent Goal 6)
