## Implementation Notes

### Screenshot Compression Strategy
```javascript
// Preferred: WebP with 85% quality
canvas.toBlob(callback, 'image/webp', 0.85);

// Fallback: PNG with compression
if (!webpSupported) {
  canvas.toBlob(callback, 'image/png');
}
```

### Component Metadata Extension
```typescript
interface VisionMetadata {
  screenshot?: {
    dataUrl: string;
    format: 'webp' | 'png';
    capturedAt: number;
    sizeKB: number;
  };
  visionAnalysis?: {
    analysis: string;
    analyzedAt: number;
    prompt: string;
    model: string;
    confidence?: number;
  };
}

interface UnifiedComponentNode extends ExistingInterface {
  visionMetadata?: VisionMetadata;
}
```

### Vision Prompt Design
Structure prompts to extract:
- Visual layout and styling details
- Component structure and hierarchy  
- Color scheme and design patterns
- UI/UX issues visible in screenshot
- Specific elements mentioned in user's refinement request

### Two-Step Generation Flow
1. **Vision Step**: Analyze screenshot + user prompt → Visual context
2. **Code Step**: Use visual context + current code + user prompt → New code

## Testing Strategy

### Screenshot Capture Testing
- [ ] Test with various component sizes and types
- [ ] Verify WebP/PNG compression ratios
- [ ] Test on different browsers and devices
- [ ] Validate image quality for AI analysis

### Vision Analysis Testing
- [ ] Test with different component types (simple, complex, styled)
- [ ] Verify vision analysis accuracy and relevance
- [ ] Test API error scenarios and fallbacks
- [ ] Measure latency and optimize prompts

### Metadata Storage Testing
- [ ] Test component export/import with vision data
- [ ] Verify metadata persistence across sessions
- [ ] Test cleanup of outdated vision data
- [ ] Validate UI display of metadata

### Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end refinement workflow with vision
- [ ] Compare results with/without vision enhancement
- [ ] Test modal UI responsiveness and UX
- [ ] Validate code generation improvements

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Screenshot library performance issues | High | Test multiple libraries, implement lazy loading |
| Vision API rate limits | Medium | Add rate limiting, retry logic, graceful fallbacks |

3. **UI Placement**: Screenshot and vision analysis shown in edit modal metadata section
4. **Vision Model**: Groq Llama-4-Maverick confirmed working in tests
5. **Data Storage**: Vision metadata stored as part of component data structure
6. **Fallback Strategy**: Original workflow continues if vision fails

### Success Metrics
- Screenshot capture success rate > 95%
- Vision analysis completion rate > 90% 
- User engagement with vision metadata display
